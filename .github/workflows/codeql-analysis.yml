# CodeQL Code Scanning Workflow
# 
# This workflow performs automated security analysis using GitHub CodeQL.
# It scans the repository for security vulnerabilities and code quality issues,
# uploads results to GitHub's Security tab, and exports SARIF artifacts for
# programmatic consumption or import into external tools.
