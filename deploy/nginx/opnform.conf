# nginx configuration snippet for MyPortal + OpnForm
#
# This file assumes that MyPortal is running on localhost:3000 (the default
# Node.js port) and that OpnForm is running on localhost:8080. Adjust the
# upstream targets if your services listen on different ports.
#
# Include this file from your main nginx server block, for example:
#   include /etc/nginx/snippets/opnform.conf;
#
# Security hardening headers are included to ensure that proxied responses are
# consistent with the rest of MyPortal. TLS termination should be configured
# on the server block that includes this snippet.
